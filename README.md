# Sunspots-numbers
This repository in included a machine learning project related to number of sunspots during almost 200 years. 

What is ***Sunspot*** ? 
> Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. (From Wiki) 

In order to be familiar with sunspots, I have provided you a picture of those.
